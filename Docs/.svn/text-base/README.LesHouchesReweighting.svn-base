                    REWEIGTHING INSTRUCTIONS


Reweighting works as follows.

1) Run pwhg_main with the line

storeinfo_rwgt 1

(that defaults to 1 anyhow) in the powheg.input file.  The program
will run as usual, but it will add a line beginning with

#rwg 

at the end of each event, containing informations that are necessary
for reweighting.

If you also include the line

lhrwgt_id 'xxx'
lhrwgt_descr 'some info'
lhrwgt_group_name 'some name'
lhrwgt_group_combine 'foo'

reweighting information in the pwgevents.lhe file will also be written.
This means the header

<header>
<initrwgt>
<weightgroup name='some name' combine='foo' > 
<weight id='xxx'> some info </weight>
</weightgroup>
</initrwgt>
</header>

If you omit lhrwgt_group_name, no weightgroup lines will appear.
If you omit the lhrwgt_group_combine line, no combine='foo' will appear.
If you omit the lhrwgt_descr line, the corresponding string will be
taken as empty.

NOTICE: in order to have reweight information in the Les Houches format,
the lhrwgt_id line must be there in the initial run.



To obtain new weights, corresponding to different pdf's or scale
choice, and insert the line

compute_rwgt 1

in the powheg.input file. Modify the powheg.input to use the different
pdf's and scale factors, or whatever parameter you like (as long as it
does not affect the generation of the Born phase space) and run
pwhg_main. The program will copy the event file generated in the
initial run into a new event file, named as OriginalName-rwgt.lhe is
created, adding a line to the end of each event, of the form

#new weight,renfact,facfact,pdf1,pdf2 <new weight> <new ren. scale factor> \
<new fact rscale fact> < new pdf # for hadron 1> <new pdf number for hadron 2>
<'mlm' or 'lha'>

where the last string specifies if the native pdf package was used (with its
own numbering scheme, or the lhapdf package).

If you want LesHouches information, add to powheg.input

lhrwgt_id 'yyy'
lhrwgt_descr 'some info'
lhrwgt_group_name 'some name'
lhrwgt_group_combine 'foo'

and the Les Houches reweight information will be updated. If the group
name is new, a new group is added to the header. If it is already in
the header, it will not be modified (i.e. the lhrwgt_group_combine
line will be ignored), and the id yyy will be inserted in the existing
group.  If no group is mentioned, the weight will be added out of the
present groups (if any).

At the end of each event you will find the initial and new weight:

<rwgt>
<wgt id='xxx'>  weight </wgt>
<wgt id='yyy'>  weight </wgt>
</rwgt>

Notice that lhrwgt_id can be used only if the initial run, with the
storeinfo_rwgt line, also carries a lhrwgt_id. Otherwise the initrwgt
header is not found and the program aborts.  Also, if the id name is
already there, the program aborts.

The typical way to use the program is to run initially with
storeinfo_rwgt 1 (that is the default).  Then run with compute_rwgt 1,
rename OriginalName-rwgt.lhe to OriginalName.lhe, and run again with
compute_rwgt 1 untill you get all the weights that you need.

The script LHReweightExample.sh in the Docs/Tests directory
illustrates the procedure for building reweighting information for 3
combinations of scale variations.
