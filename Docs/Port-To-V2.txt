Minimal instructions to port a process from the POWHEG-BOX to the POWHEG-BOX-V2.


First copy the process to V2. For example, for Wp_Wp_J_J I did:

$ svn copy  svn://powhegbox.mib.infn.it/trunk/POWHEG-BOX/Wp_Wp_J_J svn://powhegbox.mib.infn.it/trunk/User-Processes-V2/Wp_Wp_J_J

Edit nlegborn.h, and add the lines:

      integer maxalr
      parameter (maxalr=maxprocreal*nlegreal*(nlegreal-1)/2)

After the first run, the output will tell the effective minimum value
that can be used for maxalr (and also for maxborn and
maxprocreal). These numbers can be updated then, in order to save
memory.

Edit the Makefile. In the PWHG variable add:
 setlocalscales.o validflav.o pwhgreweight.o opencount.o
ubprojections.o utils.o 


If the program was using experimental features that were later integrated into
V2, eliminate them, so that the default V2 features will be used.

When comparing the output of the ported V2 version to the previous (V1) version,
in order to get binary identity between the output one must:

1) run in single process mode (i.e. remove manyseeds and parallelstage)
2) add the line
olddij 1
   to the powheg.input file.

Make sure that the implementation does not use a local copy of any file
in the mother directory POWHEG-BOX-V2; otherwise correct the local copy to match the one in the mother directory as required.
